## How to deploy

See [`main.tf`](https://github.com/runatlantis/terraform-gce-atlantis/tree/master/examples/complete/main.tf) and the [`server-atlantis.yaml`](https://github.com/runatlantis/terraform-gce-atlantis/tree/master/examples/complete/server-atlantis.yaml).

### Important

- The [`main.tf`](https://github.com/runatlantis/terraform-gce-atlantis/tree/master/examples/complete/main.tf) contains resources that are set up with only the minimum required attributes to function properly. It is recommended to add additional attributes if you plan to use this in a production environment.
